# Fitness JSON

The purpose of this mini project is to centrally locate the exercises, records, and routines for the Fitness Tracker App. This is likely a temporary solution until a persistent database solution is made.

The data will be stored in the fitness-data.json file. This file can be generated using the build NPM script from the parent project.

```
npm run build:json
```

### Accessing the Data

You can access the JSON file at the following URL once the dist folder has been deployed.d

```
